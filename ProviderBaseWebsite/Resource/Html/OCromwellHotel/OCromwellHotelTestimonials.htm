                My wife and I were house hunting in this area and came across this very comfortable hotel for something to eat. It is misleading from outside, but once inside it is a different matter. Warm, friendly plenty of atmosphere with a good menu (Bar snacks as well) and some very acceptable wine. Jane, who looked after us, was particularly helpful and went out of her way to make our visit a memorable one. Can't comment on the rooms, but the rest of it was excellent. Highly recommended. Visited Sunday 29th July 2012.(Midday)

                I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in February 2012..From email enquiries to the actual booking, the staff couldn&#39;t have been more helpful. I needed a quiet room to work and that was exactly what I got. The room was extremely large with a balcony although I see most of the rooms do have balconies and it really helps in not feeling hemmed in as I often do in hotels. The bathroom was excellent and the raindrop shower by far the most powerful I have ever experienced. The towels were large and thick and a welcome change from the stamp like offerings which can prevail in other hotels. The toiletries were of excellent quality. The bed &#45; very large and comfy. Nice sheets which where brilliant white and not too crispy.

                Good free view TV and ample space for clothes, bags etc.... Complimentary water in the room, refreshed every day. Wifi &#45; free throughout the hotel. I did find the signal a little weak at times but I was never without internet access.

                The staff &#45; now these are the jewels in the crown &#45; friendly and welcoming and genuinely interested in the guests. The food &#45; good, honest to goodness. Not fancy or fussy and plenty of it. Fresh eggs on request at breakfast. I will definitely return to the hotel when I am back in the area with work and wish I had found it years ago. I have stayed in some grimsville locations prior to this!

                The hotel is very ‘green’ and has solar panels on the hotel.
